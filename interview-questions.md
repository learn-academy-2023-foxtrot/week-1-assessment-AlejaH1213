# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: AH

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a version control software, the difference betweeh git and Github is that Github is a place to store code and collaborate remotely in that code 

Researched answer: git is free to and it is used to keep code organized. Github is a platform that uses git technology to store, share and collaborate in coding projects

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: JavaScript operators that will return a Boolean value are && (AND) and || (OR)

Researched answer: there are three operators that can return a boolean value: equality, relational and logical. The equality operators will compare if two values are the same or different and provide a true or false answer, the equality can be loose (==) or strict (===). The relational operators compares the relationship between two numbers in terms of greater than (>), greater or equal than (>=), less than (<), less than or equal (<=), or equal to (=). the logical operators && (AND) and || (OR) will compare two statements and return true or false.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: the index is the position of a value in an array, the value is the individual items in an array

Researched answer: a value in an array can also be called an element, the index is the location of that element in the array

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: both strings and arrays contain strings, the difference is that arrays can contain multiple strings while a string would only have that string. Both strings and arrays have values that have an specific index, but when asked for the index of a particular element of an array it would give the whole element and when asked for the index of an element in a string it would provide a letter. 

Researched answer: Arrays stores multiple elements in an ordered way, strings only provide one value at the time. The benefits of an array is that allows us to access individual values in that array 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: for pair programming there are two roles, the driver and the navigator. The driver is in charge of writing and executing the code, as well as interact with Github and the terminal. The navigator is in charge of provide instructions to the driver to accomplish a task in the terminal or in Github. 

Researched answer: the navigator is in charge of providing guidance and checking for errors or typos and the driver is in charge of input of the navigator's instructions 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: higher order functions are methods that are already embedded in JavaScript and are often used in arrays, they take a function as an argument <-- dont really understand what this means. 

2. Jest: Jest is a testing framework to make sure that JavaScript code is correct, it is different than using the terminal because the terminal only checks the correctness of the output and not of the JavaScript code in general

3. Objects: Objects are a composite data type that allows the user to store multiple arrays in one place, they can contain static information but also actions or methods
